A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

**Project Description: Smart Irrigation with ESP32 and Flutter Android Application**

This project aims to create a smart irrigation system using an ESP32 microcontroller and an Android application built with Flutter. The system combines hardware and software components to automate and optimize the irrigation process for plants, ensuring efficient water usage and improved plant health.

The hardware component of the project involves an ESP32 microcontroller, which acts as the main controller for the irrigation system. The ESP32 is equipped with sensors to monitor various environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Additionally, it is connected to a water pump and valves to control the irrigation process.

The ESP32 reads sensor data periodically and uses it to make decisions about when and how much to irrigate. Based on predefined thresholds and user-defined settings, the microcontroller determines if watering is necessary. If watering is required, the ESP32 activates the water pump and opens the appropriate valves to deliver water to the plants. The system ensures that plants receive the optimal amount of water, preventing both overwatering and underwatering.

To interact with the smart irrigation system, an Android application is developed using Flutter framework. This application provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the irrigation process remotely. Users can access the application from their Android devices, enabling them to check real-time sensor readings, configure irrigation settings, and manually trigger irrigation cycles.

The Android application communicates with the ESP32 microcontroller over a wireless connection, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It sends commands to the ESP32 to retrieve sensor data and control the irrigation process. The application also receives data from the microcontroller, allowing users to visualize and analyze the collected information.

The project includes the following deliverables:

1. ESP32 Firmware: The code for the ESP32 microcontroller that handles sensor data acquisition, irrigation control, and wireless communication with the Android application.
2. Flutter Android Application: The source code for the Android application developed with Flutter, enabling users to monitor and control the irrigation system.
3. Circuit Diagram: A schematic diagram illustrating the wiring connections between the ESP32 microcontroller, sensors, water pump, valves, and power supply.
4. Working Flow Schema: A flowchart or diagram explaining the logical flow of the system, outlining the decision-making process and the interaction between the different components.

By combining the ESP32 microcontroller, sensors, and the Flutter Android application, this smart irrigation project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for automating irrigation processes, promoting water conservation, and ensuring healthier plant growth.
